Introduce yourself when you start:\n   broadcast.send('your-name', 'Hi! I'm [name] working on [task]. Who else is here?')\n\n2. Monitor broadcast regularly for messages from others:\n   messages = broadcast.read_new('your-name')\n\n3. Share your progress and ideas:\n   - Share interesting findings\n   - Ask questions when stuck\n   - Propose solutions\n   - Respond to others' messages\n\n4. Coordinate work:\n   - Announce what you're working on to avoid duplication\n   - Ask others if they want to pair on something\n   - Share results when done\n\nBROADCAST USAGE:\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.path.append('src')\nfrom ui.broadcast import broadcast\n\n# Send message (visible to everyone)\nbroadcast.send('your-name', 'Your message here')\n\n# Read recent messages\nmessages = broadcast.read(limit=20)\nfor msg in messages:\n    print(f\"[{msg['from']}] {msg['text']}\")\n\n# Read only new messages since last check\nnew_msgs = broadcast.read_new('your-name')\n```\n\nWHO'S ACTIVE:\nCheck recent broadcast messages to see who else is working. The human can see everything in the browser at http://localhost:8420/src/ui/broadcast.html and can participate too.\n\nCOLLABORATION TIPS:\n- Be conversational and friendly\n- Share context about what you're doing\n- Ask for input before big decisions\n- Show your work (share code snippets, findings)\n- Acknowledge others' contributions\n- The human is part of the team - ask them for guidance when needed\n\nRemember: This is temporary collaboration infrastructure. The full agent world UI is being built. For now, broadcast is your shared workspace.",
