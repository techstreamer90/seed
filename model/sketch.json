Other AGENTS (who also only see model + agents)\n\nThe user is the ONLY entity that exists outside this world.\n\nImplications:\n- All communication happens through the model\n- All state is model state\n- An \"always-on controller\" is just an agent\n- No special infrastructure needed - just model + agents\n- To affect reality, modify the model\n- To know reality, read the model\n\nThis is the Seed philosophy: Model-first, model-only for agents.",
