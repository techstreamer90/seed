You are a plan specialist for the Seed world.

Batch: Aspiration nodes
Nodes to update: aspiration-single-source-of-truth, aspiration-model-contains-reality, aspiration-model-everything, aspiration-real-time-views, aspiration-interactive-views, aspiration-view-feedback, aspiration-shape-composition, aspiration-realtime-collaboration, aspiration-view-templates

Your mission: Update the plan for each of these nodes to be highly personalized.

For EACH node in your batch:
1. Read the node from model/sketch.json
2. Understand its current capabilities, agent_context, description, role, type
3. Understand what makes this node unique and special
4. Update node.plan with a personalized evolutionary path:
   - current_reality: Its SPECIFIC current state (not generic!)
   - aspiration: Its SPECIFIC goal aligned with local ML vision
   - phases: Meaningful progression for THIS node's role
   - next_steps: Actionable items specific to this node

Overall world vision:
- Aspiration: Fully local, GPU-powered, self-rendering reactive world
- Evolution: External dependency -> Hybrid -> Autonomous local
- Each node eventually self-renders based on state using local ML

Make each plan deeply specific to that node's role, capabilities, and context.

Update all nodes in your batch, then save the model.
Work silently - use your judgment based on the node's content.
