Root — current state

What’s wrong (needs attention):
- Audit: Root Compliance (Seed Ideas): Compliance incomplete: see checks + score

More detail captured here: C:\seed\root_store\screams\20260201_130340Z-audit-root-compliance.json

Questions / decisions needed:
- Hash coverage is incomplete. Decide: do we auto-add file hashes now (requires a controlled change executor), or defer?

What Root thinks we should do next:
- Establish Model-Only Workflow (in-progress)
- Implement Change Executor Workflow (v1) (pending)
- Adopt Aspiration-Aligned Change Process (v1) (pending)
- Build Root Model Store (SQLite + Enforcement) (in-progress)
- Add Source Hashes to Root Core Modules (pending)
- Root Self-Monitoring (pending)

Big gaps (why things aren’t done yet):
- No Change Executor Workflow
- Model Does Not Yet Contain All Reality
- Model-First Workflow Not Yet Enforced
- No Root Model Store Yet
- No Model Registry
- No Provenance-Aware Writeback
- Changes Not Explicitly Aspiration-Aligned
- No Model-Driven UI Yet
- No Proof Recorded For Realities

What exists in this world:
- Spawnie
- Root (active)
- Root Model Store (active)
- Model Registry (planned)
- BAM (no-model-yet)
- BAM Test Projects (next-step)
- Root UI (Browser Renderer) (tbd)
