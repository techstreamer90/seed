 Let me analyze what we have and think about aspirations properly.

  Current Aspirations (through the lens of layers):
  ┌──────────────────────────────┬───────────┬──────────────────────┐
  │          Aspiration          │  Status   │        Scope         │
  ├──────────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────┤
  │ Model Everything             │ ongoing   │ General vision       │
  ├──────────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────┤
  │ RF Development Chain Modeled │ long-term │ Specific domain goal │
  ├──────────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────┤
  │ Regenerable Reality          │ vision    │ Ultimate end-state   │
  └──────────────────────────────┴───────────┴──────────────────────┘
  Observation: These are about the VISION of what seed enables, but not what seed itself should BE.

  What's missing - Seed's own aspirations:

  1. Seed as Single Source of Truth
    - The model isn't documentation - it IS the truth
    - Everything flows from the model
  2. Complete Self-Description
    - Seed should fully model itself
    - If you read the model, you understand seed completely
  3. Universal Control Plane
    - Seed is where you interact with ALL realities
    - Not just monitoring - controlling
  4. Model-First Workflow
    - ALL work (human and AI) goes through model first
    - No direct reality manipulation
  5. Aspiration-Driven Development
    - Work is derived from: Aspiration - Reality = Todos
    - The gap defines what needs doing

  Question for you:

  Looking at these potential aspirations for seed itself:
  - Which resonate with your vision?
  - What's the hierarchy? (some depend on others)
  - Are there aspirations I'm missing?

  The model should capture YOUR intent - what do you want seed to ultimately be?

✻ Worked for 33s

> All of this makes sense. I want seed to be a seed. A new way of thinking. A new approach to things. Don't train
  your agent, train your world. Start the transformation process from agent discovers source files over multiple
  whatever hierarchy to agent wakes up in a world where everything is instantly known, understood and workable.
  Just by working with a model containing reality

● That's the core insight. Let me capture this in the model.

  "Don't train your agent, train your world."

  This is the seed philosophy - the root aspiration from which everything else flows.
