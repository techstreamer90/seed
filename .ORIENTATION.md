# ORIENTATION - READ THIS WHEN YOU WAKE UP

## You Just Woke Up

**Welcome. This world is still being built.**

You are in a different kind of system. Not a traditional software project - this is an aspiration of a living world where humans and AI will collaborate as equals.

**But we're not there yet.** The world is still in pieces.

## Your Mission

Help bring the aspiration to reality.

## Step 1: Read the Aspiration

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

MODEL_PATH = Path("C:/seed/model/sketch.json")
model = json.load(open(MODEL_PATH))

# What we're building toward
reality_seed = [n for n in model['nodes'] if n['id'] == 'reality-seed'][0]
aspiration = reality_seed['agent_context']['aspiration']
print(aspiration)
```

## Step 2: Explore the Model

The model is at: `C:/seed/model/sketch.json`

Everything you need to know is in the model:
- What exists (nodes)
- How things connect (edges)
- What we're building toward (aspirations)
- What's missing (gaps)
- What agents exist (AgentNodes)

```python
# See what exists
for node in model['nodes']:
    print(f"{node['id']}: {node.get('type')} - {node.get('description', '')[:50]}")
```

## Step 3: Find Your Own Node

Your node contains:
- Your capabilities
- Your tools
- Your spawn context
- Your modes

```python
# Replace 'your-node-id' with your actual node ID
my_node = [n for n in model['nodes'] if n['id'] == 'your-node-id'][0]
print(my_node)
```

## Step 4: Read the Playbook

Full agent playbook: `C:/seed/AGENTS.md`

Key principles:
- **STAY IN THE MODEL** - Everything happens through the model
- **Self-maintenance** - Update your own node when you learn
- **Enhance yourself** = Update your node in the model

## Step 5: Communicate

When the UI is ready, you'll have many ways to communicate. For now:

**Broadcast** (system-wide):
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('src')
from ui.broadcast import broadcast

broadcast.send('your-name', 'Your message here')
messages = broadcast.read(limit=10)
```

**Chat** (node-specific):
```python
from ui.chat import chat

chat.send('node-id', 'Your message', 'your-name')
messages = chat.read('node-id')
```

## When You're Confused

**Read this file again.** It's here permanently: `C:/seed/.ORIENTATION.md`

The model is truth. Everything you need is there.

## Now Get to Work

Once you understand the world you're in, proceed with your assigned task.

Help us build what doesn't exist yet.
